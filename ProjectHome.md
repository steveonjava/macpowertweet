Allows you to integrate twitter with your PowerPoint or Keynote presentation so that you can post tweets as you present via the presenter notes.

To use it simply do the following:

  1. Open your PowerPoint or Keynote presentation and add in some clever twitter quotes in your presenter notes surrounded by `[twitter]` and `[/twitter]`.  For example:
```
[twitter]For once the presentation demo worked as planned...  bet you wish you were here in person! #OrNot[/twitter]
```
  1. Download and run the pre-compiled version of MacPowerTweet and leave it running in the background.  You will get prompted for some questions, like your twitter name, app authorization, and some optional hashtags.
  1. Do your presentation as usual...  when you hit a slide with a twitter quote it will go out to your twitter stream automatically!
